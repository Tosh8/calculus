\begin{exercise}
  Find the absolute maximum and minimum of $F(x,y) = 3y-2x^2$
  constrained to the closed set bounded by the parabola $y=x^2+x-1$
  and the line $y=x$.
  
  \begin{prompt}
    The critical points within this closed set are (writing
    them in the order of increasing $x$-values):
    \begin{align*}
      \vec{c}_1 &= \vector{\answer{-3/2},\answer{-1/4}}\\
      \vec{c}_2 &= \vector{\answer{3/4},\answer{3/4}}\\
    \end{align*}
    \begin{exercise}
      \begin{hint}
        Remember to check the corners.
      \end{hint}
      The absolute maximum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{3/4},\answer{3/4}\right) = \answer{9/8}
      \]
      The absolute minimum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{-1},\answer{-1}\right) = \answer{-5}
    \]
    \end{exercise}
